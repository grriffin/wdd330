  <h1>Week 01 Notes</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Design for your smallest least capable device and you'll focus on the content. Reverse it, and you'll be cramming a marshmallow into a piggy bank.
</li>
    <li>We have a huge range of devices to deal with, and things need to work across all of them.</li>
    <li>Mobile devices are replaced more often, 2-3 devices per person now, households have a lot of devices for browsing the web.</li>
    <li>"Whatever you are doing, do mobile first" Eric Schmidt</li>
    <li>Responsive != mobile first</li>
    <li>Touch interaction issues are different than desktop</li>
    <li>
      <div>Things to remember
        <ul>
          <li>Desktop computer sales have been declining since 2011</li>
          <li>You don't see people with heads in laptops</li>
          <li>Start small, and scale up (growing works, shrinking doesn't)</li>
          <li>Mobile is not a fad</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>It's really hard to design products from focus groups, people don't know what they want Steve Jobs</li>
    <li>Be There, Be Useful, Be Quick</li>
    <li><img src="eliminatesteps.png" alt="Eliminating unnecessary steps" width="600"></li>
    <li>Reachability matters - how they handle their device 49% use one handed grip</li>
    <li>1/2 second delay, 20% drop in traffic (Google)</li>
    <li>Speed matters</li>
    <li>"Software sucks"</li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <span>Primary controls</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Move primary controls to the bottom, they won't have to reach, improved engagement</li>
          <li>Hamburger menu - many users don't know what this button is, Menu with a border increased engagement</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <span>Mobile inputs - forms</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Forms often have too much information</li>
          <li>Look cramped</li>
          <li>Remove labels and use placeholders</li>
          <li>Use float labels to make sure they still know what the fields are</li>
          <li>Ask for how they want to be contacted, and only ask for those details</li>
          <li>Do anything you can to reduce how much they have to fill out</li>
          <li>Use pagination (with progress indicator) if you absolutely must</li>
          <li>Enable auto complete</li>
          <li>Maybe show passwords by default on mobile, and allow them to hide rather than the opposite</li>
          <li>Make sure you do what's necessary to bring up the right keyboard for the input</li>
          <li>Turn phone numbers into links</li>

        </ul>
      </div>
    </li>

          <li>Don't use pop ups or "in betweener" ads</li>
          <li>Don't put too many ads before the content</li>
          <li>Make ads small and simple</li>
          <li>Content first</li>
        </ul>
